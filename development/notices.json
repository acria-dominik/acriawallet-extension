[{"read":false,"date":"Fri Dec 16 2016","title":"Ending Morden Support","body":"Due to [recent events](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/11/20/from-morden-to-ropsten/), MetaMask is now deprecating support for the Morden Test Network.\n\nUsers will still be able to access Morden through a locally hosted node, but we will no longer be providing hosted access to this network through [Infura](http://infura.io/).\n\nPlease use the new Ropsten Network as your new default test network.\n\nYou can fund your Ropsten account using the buy button on your account page.\n\nBest wishes!\nThe MetaMask Team\n\n","id":0}]
