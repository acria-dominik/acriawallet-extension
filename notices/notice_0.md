Due to [recent events](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/11/20/from-morden-to-ropsten/), MetaMask is now deprecating support for the Morden Test Network.

Users will still be able to access Morden through a locally hosted node, but we will no longer be providing hosted access to this network through [Infura](http://infura.io/).

Please use the new Ropsten Network as your new default test network.

You can fund your Ropsten account using the buy button on your account page.

Best wishes!
The MetaMask Team
