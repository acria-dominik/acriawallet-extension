# Developing our Responsive UI

To allow parallel development of a new responsive version of our interface, we have forked our `ui` folder into two sub-folders:

- ui/classic (our original extension UI, fixed dimensions)
- ui/responsive (our new, responsive UI)

To visit this new responsive ui while in development mode (`npm start`) simply visit:
