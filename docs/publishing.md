# Publishing Guide

When publishing a new version of MetaMask, we follow this procedure:

1. `npm run dist` to generate the latest build.
2. Publish to chrome store.
3. Publish to firefox addon marketplace.
4. Post on Github releases page.
5. `npm run announce`, post that announcement in our public places.
